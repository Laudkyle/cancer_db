        "question": "What is cancer?",
        "answer": "Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells in the body."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do normal cells differ from cancer cells?",
        "answer": "Normal cells follow a regulated process of growth, division, and death. Cancer cells, however, evade this control mechanism, leading to uncontrolled growth and the formation of tumors."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are tumors?",
        "answer": "Tumors are abnormal masses of tissue formed by the accumulation of cancer cells. They can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between benign and malignant tumors?",
        "answer": "Benign tumors are non-cancerous and do not invade nearby tissues or spread to other parts of the body. Malignant tumors are cancerous and can invade surrounding tissues, spreading to other organs through the bloodstream or lymphatic system."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is metastasis in cancer?",
        "answer": "Metastasis is the process by which cancer cells spread from the original (primary) tumor to other parts of the body, forming new (secondary) tumors."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does cancer affect the body's normal functions?",
        "answer": "Cancer disrupts normal bodily functions by competing for resources, invading surrounding tissues, and interfering with the normal regulatory mechanisms that maintain balance in the body."
      },
      {
        "question": "What causes the genetic changes leading to cancer?",
        "answer": "Genetic changes, or mutations, can be caused by various factors, including exposure to carcinogens, genetic predisposition, and random errors during cell division."

      },
      {
        "question": "What is the TNM staging system in cancer?",
        "answer": "The TNM staging system assesses the extent of cancer based on three key factors: T (tumor size and invasion), N (lymph node involvement), and M (presence of distant metastasis)."
      },
      {
