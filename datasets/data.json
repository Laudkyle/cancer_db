      "question": "What is the role of imaging tests in monitoring multiple myeloma?",
      "answer": "Imaging tests such as X-rays, MRI, and CT scans play a crucial role in monitoring the progression and response to treatment in multiple myeloma. These tests help assess the extent of bone involvement, detect any new lesions, and guide treatment decisions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What supportive care measures are available for individuals with multiple myeloma?",
      "answer": "Supportive care for individuals with multiple myeloma may include pain management, nutritional support, addressing anemia and other blood-related issues, management of bone health, and psychological support. A multidisciplinary approach is essential to address the diverse needs of patients."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) relate to the risk of multiple myeloma?",
      "answer": "Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a condition characterized by the presence of abnormal proteins (M proteins) in the blood without the typical signs of multiple myeloma. MGUS increases the risk of developing multiple myeloma over time, although not everyone with MGUS progresses to myeloma."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of maintenance therapy in multiple myeloma treatment?",
      "answer": "Maintenance therapy in multiple myeloma involves ongoing treatment, often with a lower dose of chemotherapy, immunomodulatory drugs, or other agents, to prolong the duration of remission and manage the disease as a chronic condition. Maintenance therapy aims to prevent or delay relapse."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the International Staging System (ISS) categorize multiple myeloma?",
      "answer": "The International Staging System (ISS) categorizes multiple myeloma based on two factors: beta-2 microglobulin levels and albumin levels. The ISS helps stratify patients into different risk groups, guiding treatment decisions and providing prognostic information."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of bisphosphonates in multiple myeloma treatment?",
      "answer": "Bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid and pamidronate, are drugs that help strengthen bones and reduce the risk of fractures in multiple myeloma. These drugs are often used as part of the treatment plan to address bone-related issues associated with myeloma."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of abnormal antibodies impact the diagnosis of multiple myeloma?",
      "answer": "The presence of abnormal antibodies, particularly monoclonal proteins (M proteins), is a key diagnostic feature of multiple myeloma. Blood tests, including serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE), help detect and characterize these abnormal proteins, contributing to the diagnosis and monitoring of the disease."
